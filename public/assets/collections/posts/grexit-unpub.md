I have worked professionally for over 25 years. In those years, I have worked for many companies and in many industries; serving most of them in the technology spectrum in one way or another. Most of the time, I have really enjoyed what I did for a living. But sometimes I did not enjoy it so much. I have worked for great companies with fantastic supervisors and with not so great companies for less than ideal supervisors. After nearly 4 years with a company where I began employment feeling it was one of the greatest companies, I found myself drowning in a toxic sludge that nearly destroyed me. But what happened that made it feel this way and what did I do about it?

# Two Guys From Indy

Before I dig in deep, I want to tell you about the company I worked for just before I worked for a toxic company. After my first marriage came to an end, I found myself in need of employment. The whole of the previous year had found me moving between a few companies and even between states. I had been laid off from one job in Illinois after living there for 4 years and was relocated by another back to Indianapolis. Our time in Illinois paid its toll on the marriage and the move back was not smooth. A few months after moving back, I was let go from the new job due to lack of performance. You see, I had a hard time with the transition and the stress from the previous 4 years was a lot to handle. Shortly after this, my wife and I separated and our marriage never recovered.

This all happened in the fall of 2009. In December of that year, I landed a job that would change the course of my future. A couple of really awesome dudes had started a nice software firm in Indianapolis they aptly named [Two Guys From Indy](https://www.tgfi.net), or TGFI for short. They had just landed a lucrative contract with a large company with a rich history in our city and they were looking for some developers to help serve that contract. My starting salary was quite modest and left plenty of room for me to prove myself a great software engineer. By the end of my first year with TGFI I was awarded with a 15% raise.

Another benefit for having such appreciative bosses with a lucrative contract is the company had plenty of extra perks. One of the best were the annual employee appreciation outings and dinners. There were at least 4 times where the company would take all employees and 1 guest each to a restaurant at Christmas time where each plate was well over $100. Such places would include [Morton's](https://www.mortons.com) (Indy location now closed due to the 2020-2021 pandemic), [The Capital Grille](https://www.thecapitalgrille.com/locations/in/indianapolis/indianapolis/8032), [Harry & Izzy's](https://www.harryandizzys.com), and [Ruth's Chris](https://www.ruthschris.com/restaurant-locations/indianapolis-northside/). And at each of these dinners, the company would give us a bonus based on our performance and how the contract we were working on was going. For me, this was typically in the thousands. And if that wasn't enough, the company also paid the full premium for our health insurance!

Alas, all good things come to an end. In 2015 that big contract came to an end as the client was consolidating their IT contracts into fewer contractors. I continued working on other contract work until January 2016 when the company had to lay me off. It wasn't always the best work. However, it was by far the best company I have ever worked for. And although they eventually had to lay off all of their employees, I'm very happy the two owners are still in business today.

# Dawn of a new Era

A few months after my time ended with TGFI, I was contacted directly over LinkedIn by the president of a small but mighty vending machine company located on the far Eastside of Indianapolis. I looked into the company and discovered it was the remaining entity from an Indianapolis dynasty in the vending machine industry started by a set of brothers decades before. Growing up near Indy, I was quite familiar with this history and I was excited to be contacted by them. I, of course, responded with my resume and a phone interview followed shortly.

The phone interview did not go as well as I had hoped due to a poor cell signal at the time. However, the Director of Technology decided to have me come into their office for a face-to-face interview in the second round despite that issue. This second interview went perfectly and I was offered a job on the spot. This seemed like a match made in Heaven. The excitement of landing this job with a company I was quite fond of that worked with some of the coolest technology was almost too good to be true!

As it is with most jobs, I started out with a lot of hope and vision of how I could impact the life of the company and its clients. In fact, I even put together a proof of concept for how we could build our mobile app in house for a fraction of the cost we were already paying a third party vendor. I put it together in just three hours! My supervisor was impressed, but he did not decide to bring the project in house after all. Shortly after that, he resigned. Not only was it puzzling why he wouldn't allow us to make the mobile app ourselves, it was equally puzzling he would resign so quickly after hiring a few of us.

Just before his resignation, one of the former employees came back as an Assistant Director of Technology. What we later found out was he was brought back to replace the Director. These chain of events quickly dissolved my excitement and I began to question if I had made the right decision to join the team. Me being me, I thought it was a good idea to do anything I could to help make things better. So I worked closely with the new Director to help implement his new vision. This went rather well and we are friends to this day. However, six months later, he too resigned.

# Rise to the Occasion

Against my better judgement, I threw my hat in the ring and offered my service to the president of the company as the new Director of Technology. He accepted on a trial basis to be evaluated the first three months of 2017. As you can imagine, I really shined in this new role and I was made officially the Director. This is when I began realizing why my predecessors left. However, once again, I thought it was a good idea to do anything I could to help make things better.

The first thing I did to improve things was mend some old wounds between the IT department and the customer service department. The manager of that department at the time had issues with my predecessors. The manager I replaced had several quite vocal disagreements with her. The office we worked in at the time wasn't very large. So it was pretty easy to hear their arguments. I wanted to be sure that the past did not repeat itself.

Another opportunity was to work more closely with the president of the company. Just like with the customer service manager, my predecessors had issues with the president. In this case, it was only the president who did the shouting. When I assumed the responsibilities of the Directory position, the shouting came to an end. My personality was much more timid than my predecessors'. They were both great guys. But it would seem the president felt he could yell and shout without causing them any distress. I myself, on the other hand, would never join in on the shouting matches. So, the president never once raised his voice to me.

My optimism and good fortunes as the new Director of Technology would not last long. After my three month probationary period, I was given full responsibilities of the office and was actually promoted to the CTO level. However, I quickly found that the president of the company would constantly undermining my decisions. And he would frequently fuel the frictions between the IT and customer service departments. He was always questioning my decisions and recommendations and would never give credit where it was due anytime the IT department saved the day. He would belittle my staff every time I would meet with him privately and would complain about how much he was paying them. He always had the expectation that everyone on the IT staff should work 60-80 hours a week simply because they were the highest paid staff.

There was never a sense of teamwork among the different teams at the company. And that all came from the top position. I quickly found why my predecessors left the company. And it didn't take me long to want to leave myself. When I was just a regular member of the staff, I did not see much of what was going on behind the scenes. As a manager who was "second in command", I could see everything. And I did not like what I saw. Having previously been in narcissistic relations in the past, I could clearly see the signs that our leader not only wanted full control of every aspect of the company, he also wanted all of us to come to him to resolve the issues he was creating.

# Grexit 1.0

After a year and three months in this role, and dealing with toxic behaviors of the president he burdened on myself and others in the company, I was growing weary of the environment. I was typically there before anyone else and often left after everyone. It wasn't that I did not delegate. In fact, I delegated quite a bit. However, the demands of the president and the constant frustrations of making the customer service management happy, it was far from a 9 to 5 type of job.

The final straw came when I and my team had missed a deadline that the president and customer service manager imposed on me and my team, communicated to the client, and then went out of their way to ensure we would miss it. This was not uncommon actually. However, in this case, the president expressed his disappointment in me personally on the missed deadline. Until that moment, I had managed to meet or exceed expectations in every project despite unreasonable demands.

Despite all that I had personally accomplished at the company, it was at that moment I decided it was time for me to move on. It is traditional for an employee to turn in a 2 weeks notice. Furthermore, it is traditional to hand the resignation notice to one's direct supervisor. I decided I did not want to do either and instead sent my notice of immediate resignation to the CEO of the company. Having dealt with this for 15 months, I felt so broken and I just had to walk away. I did regret that I was doing this to the CEO. After all, he had no idea any of this was going on in his company. However, dealing with the president was not really an option.

What happened next was quite unexpected. Both the CEO and the president were not only taken by surprise, they wanted to do whatever it took to keep me there. The following week, the CEO offered to meet with me and asked if I would be fine with the president also being present. I agreed to a meeting in a public place as I was not sure what to expect. The CEO wanted to offer that I stay with the company as I transitioned a new CTO to replace me, I would then be able to work from home along with my salary remaining the same. In addition, I was going to be paid for the time between my resignation and when I would return to work without it being charged against my PTO bank.

I felt this was a generous offer and ultimately agreed to it. I looked at this as another opportunity to make a difference and could see that my stress level would diminish since most of the primary responsibilities were going to be transfer to a new CTO. I was going to get to go back to being a software engineer, in fact. I was so excited about the possibilities I could not see that it was actually the president's way of saving face with the CEO and to further manipulate the situation he had fostered. And as it turned out, the president actually planned to bring in one of his friends as the new CTO.

# Grexit 2.0

One of the things I agreed to was to remain in the office while the new CTO was transitioned into his role and I was transitioned into my new role. The first sign things weren't on the level came when the president changed the narrative to indicate he was going to leave it up to the new CTO as to whether or not I would be able to work from home. He did not want to tie the hands of the new guy, so to speak. What my replacement and I settled on was 1 day a week in the office. This worked for a time.

By the end of 2018, another change to the original agreement came in for the form of my salary. The agreement was it would not change; which I accepted and understood that I would likely never get a raise if I remained at the company. The way the president presented it to me was that the CEO was making a million dollar investment in me over a 10 year period. At the time, I was making just over $100k per year. However, starting in 2019, the president was going to make a $12k cut per year.

After the pay decreased was implemented, another change was on the horizon. The CTO decided he wanted me to be in the office more often. It started as me being in the office 2 days instead of 1. Not long after that, it became 3 days. At first, this was not a major problem as they were not full work days. I was still allowed the flexibility to come in after taking our youngest to school and going back home after I picked him up. However, by October 2019, the president changed the policy to be that I had to be in the office 3 days a week for 8 hours each of those days. This was regardless of my responsibilities with taking our youngest to school and picking him up.

Getting a $12k cut in salary and now needing to spend 3 hours a day on the road for 3 days a week in order to accommodate school schedules with the latest demand of the president for me to be in the office for 8 hours 3 days, it all really took a toll on me. Furthermore, the youngest has autism and the strange travel schedule I was forced to make was stressing him out. I was not even able to transition into the new schedule. It took place without warning. You simply cannot do that to a child with autism. Once again, I found myself resigning directly to the CEO with the added statement that I could no longer put my family through this.

This time, I did not look back. Nothing was offered to me in terms of trying to get me to stay. And I made it clear I did not wish to work with them in the future. I still here stories of how things are at the company. And things have not improved whatsoever. There are a few who remain there because they have no where else to work. And the events of 2020 prevented them from finding new employment. The company has actually been hit pretty hard with the effects of the pandemic. Although my heart goes out to my friends there, I do not feel bad that the company might be seeing its last days.

# Lessons Learned

As you can imagine, there was a drastic contrast between the company I was forced to leave at the beginning of 2016 and the one I ran from at the end of 2019. The former was run by some of the most generous leaders I have had the pleasure of working with. The latter, lead by a master manipulator with narcissistic tendencies. One was a joy to work for, and the other was a nearly 4 year nightmare. As I reflect on the events of the past decade at these two polar opposites, I have learned some quite valuable lessons.

One lesson, and likely the most important one, is companies are not typically as loyal to their employees as you are to them. There are, of course, exceptions to this as I experienced with TGFI. However, this has been a rare exception in my career. Every other company I have worked directly for did not have the same level of loyalty I had. Especially as was the case in the other company mentioned above, with all of the broken promises.

Another lesson would be that I should follow my intuition. When I first saw signs of problems, rather than thinking I could help make the company better, it is more likely that I should just make plans to leave. Some environments are just too toxic for one person or a few people to make enough difference. This is especially true for smaller companies that do not answer to a board.

The most valuable lesson I learned in that experience, however, was knowing myself and my own limitations. I honestly did not know just how much I could handle. And I can definitely handle quite a bit more than I thought I could. But at what cost? What that toxic environment was doing to me affected everyone around me. This was especially the case at home. So moving forward, I will be evaluating the environment on a constant basis for my own sake and that of my family.

If you feel you are working in a toxic environment, I encourage you to ask yourself the tough question about whether it is time to move on or not. Feel free to [connect with me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/gregmarine) and I would be happy to discuss your situation.
