For thousands of years, mankind has been contemplating and philosophizing, what I have come to accept as, the importance balance plays in life. In my own life, this has come in many forms. From compensation for work I do for an employer to faith-based organized religion, I have always had a need to find some sort of balance. This has been difficult to achieve at times, however. Sometimes outside sources such as world events can effect my balance. Other times, it can simply be my own inner thoughts. The former is out of my own control. However, the latter is quite within my grasp. To help with inner thoughts, I look to some seemingly odd, and very small, places.

# Christianity 101

In my article _[When to Give Up](/posts/when-to-give-up)_, I mentioned I was raised in the church. Among other things, I was taught it was important to pray to God concerning everything and meditate on the scriptures from the Christian Holy Bible. Prayer and meditation is a very personal experience that exists in several religions. And for very good reason. In most cases, these exercises will allow you to relax, recharge, and refocus on what matters most.

In the case of Christianity, prayer is a communication channel to the Creator of all things. Growing up I believed that this dialog would include God answering my prayers in a way that would make sense to me. As I became a teenaged boy, I quickly realized this was not the case. Most of the time, what I thought were answers from God would not make much sense at all. But I would always try to accept whatever form the answer would come in.

Meditating on the scriptures would most often be through Bible study groups at church. However, I would also try to find time at home to read and ponder what the original author had intended to convey in their words. Over all, the Bible was a blueprint for how I wanted to live my life and how I would choose what other things and who would influence me. My understanding of what I was reading was quite limited in my early years. And once again, as I became a teenaged boy, I quickly realized my understanding was a bit off.

One of the topics that interested me most in my church youth group was the study of other religions. Of those we studied, there seemed to be a common theme. Each had some sort of god system, a scripture text, a way to live a good life, and a sense of community. However, all of them seemed to be at odds with each other. I thought to myself, how could this be. With so many similarities, how could all of these religions teach their followers to hate each other so much. It was at this time I felt they must all be wrong.

# Newton's Laws

Sir [Isaac Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton) was an English "[natural philosopher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_philosophy)" who was one of the most influential scientists of all time. Like me, he too was born into the Christian faith. Not only did he study and set many of the foundational principles of mathematics, science, and physics, he also studied Christianity in such a way that he would not have been considered orthodox by mainstream Christianity; even today!

One of his more notable contributions to science, that can also be applied to thought itself, are [Newton's laws of motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton's_laws_of_motion). The first law is that an object which is at rest will remain at rest, and an object which is in motion will stay in motion. This is, of course, unless the object is acted upon by an external force. The second law tells us that the rate of change in momentum of an object over time is directly related to the force applied and occurs in the same direction as is applied. The third, and final, law states that all forces between two objects exist in equal magnitude and of opposite direction. In other words, every action has an equal and opposite reaction.

How one might apply this to thought is actually quite simple. For the first law, when my mind is clear and focused, it will remain that way. Also, if my thoughts are running wild, they too will remain to run wild. That is, until something I am doing, or when something outside of myself, forces me to make a change in thought. Enjoying music, reading, and television are a few ways I am able to clear my mind and stay focused. Worrying about my family or other loved ones has always been a sure fire way to get my thoughts running wild. And probably the number one way to get my thoughts derailed is when I am in deep thought and I am interrupted by a phone call or a knock on the door!

The rate of change in my thoughts has always been directly proportional, in terms of momentum, as the forces applied to them. And most definitely in the same direction. This is Newton's second law without a doubt. When negative thoughts creep in and there are no positive influences, my mind can only go to more negative thoughts. Conversely, when positive thoughts and influence begin to occur, my train of thought can remain on that positive track for quite a while.

Finally, thought life often tends to find its way back around. For example, in my darkest of days, all of those negative thoughts come to a head. And like an explosion, my mind will break and suddenly only positive thoughts will flow. It is almost like my brain finally pushes back and I have nowhere else to go except in the opposite direction! Of the three, this is probably the least "law like" interpretation. Then again, there aren't any true laws that can be 100% applied to thoughts. The point I am attempting to relate to this is that, for me, it is common for this to happen.

# Christianity 201

Almost 4 years after that religious study in youth group, I had what I can only describe as an epiphany. Although I still felt that all of the religions of the world should be able to get along, I was certain religion had its place in my life. Not so much the organized religion as one might view an religion, but more of what I feel faith is all about. I will not go into too much detail on this as of the core beliefs I hold on faith is that it is completely personal. I cannot in anyway fully describe what faith is to me because no one else has shared my exact experiences. Nor do I feel like I have it all figured out. In fact, some believe there is only one true faith. I, however, do not subscribe to that belief.

As I mentioned before, the Christian Holy Bible has been my guide to almost ever choice I make. The inspired Word of God has, to this day, been a strong guiding force for my life. It influences decisions I make and how I choose to live my own life. However, it no longer has an influence on how I feel about others or their choices and beliefs. Call it maturity, or call it clarity, I have found that the lessons of the Old Testament and the teachings of the New Testament are most certainly not teaching me to assert my own choices and beliefs on others.

So, what is up with this come to Jesus moment for me?!? Well, I would have to say it is all about how Jesus lived. He questioned the teachings of the church of the day [need cite], He loved everyone [need cite], and He was LOVE [need cite]! Although I am not Jesus, or close to even perfect for that matter, I can completely related to questioning what I have been taught by the church, how to love everyone, and how to be LOVE for someone else.

2 failed marriages, and 5 church congregations later, I'm still looking for my place in Christianity.

I feel balance is the important piece of the puzzle missing for me.
