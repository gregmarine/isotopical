# Overview

My family absolutely loves chicken wings! It can be quite an expensive treat if we always go out to a restaurant to get them. So, I decided I would learn how to make them myself. After a lot of trial and error, I have developed what I think is the perfect way of making them at home. They have become so popular in my family, I have also gone on to make them for Super Bowl parties! The greatest compliment I have received for these is that there is never any leftovers! If you want crispy wings that scale to any size dinner or party, this is the recipe you want!

4. Preheat oven to 250F
5. Line oven pan with aluminum foil, shiny side up, and place baking rack in pan

11. Bake for 45 minutes on middle rack

    1.  If using a dry rub, coat both sides of each wing with olive oil and apply desired amount of rub
13. Set broiler to highest setting and move rack to the highest level
14. Place wings back in oven on highest rack and broil for about 1-2 minutes
15. Serve with remaining sauce (if using sauce)

# Notes

Baking at 250F on the bottom rack allows the fat to begin to render and draws out the extra moisture to the skin due to the baking powder. Then baking at the higher temp of 400F does the actual cooking of the chicken inside.

This serves enough wings for 2 people. Multiply everything by how many you need to serve based on this recipe.
