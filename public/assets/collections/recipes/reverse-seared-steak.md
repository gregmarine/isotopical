# Notes

Be sure to cut the chicken breasts in half evenly. If one half is thicker than the other, be sure to pound the thicker side to be the same thickness as the lessor. This is the ensure the chicken roasts at the same rate.

Even if you are looking for low carb chicken, this recipe works. The amount of brown sugar spread over the 4 halves is approximately 2.25g net carbs.
