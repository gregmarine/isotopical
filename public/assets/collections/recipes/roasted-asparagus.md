# Overview

I have always found it difficult to cook asparagus. Remove it from heat too early and they are extremely tough. Leave it on heat too long and they become super gross. But when cooked properly, asparagus is one of the most wonderful vegetables I have every tasted. Up until now, I really only enjoyed the way it is prepared at a fancy restaurant. But I have finally found the best way for me to enjoy asparagus at home!

# Notes

Be sure to cut the chicken breasts in half evenly. If one half is thicker than the other, be sure to pound the thicker side to be the same thickness as the lessor. This is the ensure the chicken roasts at the same rate.

Even if you are looking for low carb chicken, this recipe works. The amount of brown sugar spread over the 4 halves is approximately 2.25g net carbs.
