# Overview

I have always found it difficult to cook asparagus. Remove it from the pan too early and they are extremely tough. Leave it in the pan too long and they become super gross. But when cooked properly, asparagus is one of the most wonderful vegetables I have every tasted. Up until now, I really only enjoyed the way it is prepared at fancy restaurants. But I have finally found the best way for me to enjoy asparagus at home!

# Notes

This recipe pairs nicely with my [Roasted Pork Ribs](/recipes/roasted-pork-ribs), [Roasted Chicken Breast](/recipes/roasted-chicken-breast), or [Reverse Seared Steak](/recipes/reverse-seared-steak) recipes.

There are certainly other ways to cook asparagus. However, this has been then only sure way for this home "chef" to get it just right!
