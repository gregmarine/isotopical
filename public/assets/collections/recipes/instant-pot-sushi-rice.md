# Overview

I haven't always loved sushi like I do today. In fact, the first time I had it I swore I would never try it again! Fast forward about 15 years and I finally did give it another try. This time I loved it! Then, in May 2018, I took a class on how to make the rice and do sushi rolls. Since I am a bit of a "home chef" and owner of an Instant Pot, I naturally wanted to find a way to make the sushi rice in my Instant Pot. This recipe is the result of my love for cooking and to save money making sushi at home!

# Ingredients

- 1 cup sushi rice (I buy Nishiki brand rice from my local grocery store)
- 1 cup water
- 1/4 cup Japanese seasoned rice vinegar
- 1 tsp salt
- 1 tbsp sugar

# Instructions

1. Rinse the rice to remove excess starch
   1. Put rice in a bowl and fill the bowl with water until all of the rice is submerged
   2. Gently stir the rice with your hand so it rubs against your fingers, the sides of the bowl, and other grains
   3. Pour water out without pouring out the rice
   4. Repeat above steps until the water being poured out is clear
2. Put rinsed rice and water into the Instant Pot
3. Place the lid on the Instant Pot and set the pressure valve to the sealed position
4. Set Instant Pot to High Pressure for 0 minutes
5. Once the pressure cycle is complete, allow the Instant Pot to natural release
6. Mix the Japanese seasoned rice vinegar, salt, and sugar in a microwave safe bowl
7. After the Instant Pot has been naturally releasing for 10 minutes, microwave the mixture on high for 1 minute (increase the time for low wattage microwaves)
8. Stir the mixture so that the salt and sugar fully dissolve in the vinegar
9. If the natural release isn't finished after 20 minutes, set the pressure valve to release the remaining pressure
10. Remove rice from the Instant Pot and place in a large bowl
11. Slowly pour vinegar mixture over rice
12. Gently knead the rice to mix rice with the vinegar mixture by folding using a rice spoon
